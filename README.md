BonfiSoft Development Tracker is a fully self-contained, project-local issue tracker for VS Code. No external services, no accounts, no cloud dependency — your data lives where your code lives.

## Features

### Core Issue Tracking

- **Seven issue types**: Bug, Enhancement, Feature, Task, Question, Documentation, Other
- **Five severity levels**: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Trivial
- **Five urgency levels**: Immediate, High, Normal, Low, Whenever
- **Seven status values**: Open, In Progress, In Review, On Hold, Closed, Resolved, Wont Fix
- **Version linking**: Attach issues to git tags for "reported in" and "fixed in" version
- **Code linking**: Link issues directly to file lines with CodeLens and gutter decorations

### Organization

- **Milestones** — Group issues by release milestone with progress tracking
- **Sprints** — Agile sprint workflow with start/end dates and status (planned/active/completed/cancelled)
- **Tags** — Free-form labels for cross-cutting concerns
- **Relations** — Link issues as: blocks / blocked-by / duplicates / related-to / parent-of / child-of / clones

### Developer Workflow

- **Time Tracking** — Log hours per issue with comments; view totals in the sidebar
- **Templates** — Define issue templates with pre-filled fields (ships with Bug, Feature, Task templates)
- **Changelog Generator** — Render Markdown or plain-text changelogs from resolved issues grouped by version
- **Export / Import** — JSON (full re-import), CSV, Markdown, or GitHub Issues JSON format
- **Full-text Search** — Search across title, description, tags, comments, and assignee

### VS Code Integration

- **Primary sidebar** — Four views: Issues, Milestones, Sprints, Time Tracking
- **Grouping** — Group issues by status, type, severity, urgency, milestone, sprint, or assignee
- **CodeLens** — Inline `[🔗 Issue #N: <title>]` lens above linked lines — click to view
- **Gutter decorations** — Visual marker on every line linked to an issue
- **Status bar** — Live count of open / critical issues; red background when critical exist
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Four built-in keybindings (configurable)
- **Stale detection** — Issues open > 30 days without activity are automatically flagged

## Configuration

All settings are under `vetspresso-issues.*`:

| `defaultAssignee` | `""` | Default assignee username for new issues |
| `defaultIssueType` | `bug` | Default issue type pre-selected when creating a new issue |
| `staleIssueDays` | `30` | Days without activity before an open issue is flagged as stale |

### Storage Locations

**Workspace storage** (`.vscode/issues/`) — default

- Can be committed to git and shared with your team
- One directory per project, automatically scoped
- Best for team projects

**Global storage** (VS Code `globalStorageUri`)

- Machine-local, never shared via git
- Useful for personal tracking on projects you don't control
- Siloed per workspace folder using a namespace hash

## Issue Detail Panel

Click any issue in the sidebar (or run `Issues: View Issue`) to open the detail panel.

The panel shows all issue fields and allows inline:

- Status changes via dropdown
- Assignee edit (click to edit in-place)
- Comments with full Markdown body
- Time log entries
- Code link navigation (click to jump to linked file/line)
- Relation navigation (click to view related issue)

---

## Code Linking

1. Select one or more lines in any file
2. Run `Issues: Link Code to Issue` (`Ctrl+Alt+L`)
3. Pick the issue to link
4. A 🔗 gutter icon and CodeLens appear at the linked lines

A single issue can be linked to multiple code locations. Remove links from the issue detail panel.

---

## Git Version Integration

When you create an issue, the extension reads your current git tag (if any) and pre-fills the "Reported In" field. When you resolve an issue, you choose from your existing tags for the "Fixed In" field.

Use `Issues: Open Current Version Issues` to quickly see all issues reported in or targeting the current tag.

---

## Changelog Generation

Run `Issues: Generate Changelog` from the Command Palette:

1. Optionally filter to a specific version
2. Choose format (Markdown or plain text)
3. The changelog opens in an editor tab, grouped by version and type
4. Optionally Save as `CHANGELOG.md` in the workspace root

Only resolved or closed issues with a "Fixed In" version are included.

---

## Export & Import

**Export** (`Issues: Export Issues`):

- **JSON** — Full export, re-importable (schema-versioned)
- **CSV** — Spreadsheet-compatible (title, status, type, severity, etc.)
- **Markdown** — Formatted table with details block per issue
- **GitHub Issues JSON** — Compatible with GitHub's bulk issue import format

**Import** (`Issues: Import Issues`):

- Accepts the JSON export format
- Deduplicates by UUID — existing issues with the same ID are skipped (not overwritten)
- Returns a count of imported vs. skipped issues

---

## Dashboard

Run `Issues: Open Dashboard` (`Ctrl+Alt+D`) to open the metrics dashboard:

- KPI cards: total, open, in-progress, resolved, critical, stale
- Bar charts: issues by status, severity, type
- Milestone progress table (open/total issues per milestone)
- Sprint burn table (open/total issues per sprint)

The dashboard refreshes automatically when issue data changes.

## Multi-root Workspace Support

For workspaces with multiple folders, set `vetspresso-issues.multiRootStorage`:

- `shared` — All folders use a single issue store (the store root is the first workspace folder)
- `perFolder` — Each folder has its own independent issue store
